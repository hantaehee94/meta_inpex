As the globe prepares to transition away from fossil fuels, understanding the factors and parameters influencing the penetration of clean energy into existing energy markets has become a critical step. Controversies surrounding the environmental impacts of renewable technologies, variability in market structures, and economic pressures on clean energy companies can complicate this transition. Thus, resources must be focused in the right areas to ensure the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions is being met adequately. Strategic investments in high-potential parameters, alongside targeted policy interventions and technological advancements, can maximize the impact of clean energy initiatives while ensuring long-term sustainability and economic viability. This study leverages machine learning models to analyze and focus on geographic as well as policy-driven parameters that have influenced clean energy adoption over the past few years, focusing on various regions in New York State. Key parameters analyzed include solar and wind potential, average energy prices, subsidy amounts, grid capacity, public awareness, renewable and fossil energy market shares, and policy support indices.

Since directly observing strata behavior is challenging, downscaled similar material simulations are often relied upon as a proven effective method for strata pattern analysis. Traditionally, mere visual inspection or stress and displacement monitoring of the simulation have been employed for risk analysis and often causes imprecise and subjective interpretations. With recent advancements in deep learning image processing models which enabled quantitative studies on variation dynamics of image sequences, this study proposes a novel method for analyzing strata behavior patterns by applying the spatiotemporal data feature extracting capability of the ConvLSTM model on a carefully conducted similar material experiment. The approach involves reconstructing the pre-processed image sequence data using ConvLSTM, thereby predicting and enhancing visual inspection by dynamically highlighting major strata fracture and breakage evolvements. Critical periods of rapid strata behavior are also reliably identified by thresholding the reconstruction errors. Additionally, high-risk areas in each critical period are delineated using image differentiation and the fast Non-local Means (NLM) denoising algorithm. While other applicable models including ConvLSTM-AutoEncoder (ConvLSTM-AE) and TCN-AutoEncoder (TCN-AE) also perform well, the predictive ConvLSTM model stands out with its superior reconstruction visual distinctiveness and model stability in the analysis. Withprovided valuable spatiotemporal information for understanding mining-induced strata behavior patterns, the obtained promising results offer precise dynamic guidance on predicting the formation of water inflow channels."

The dataset was developed as part of the research project titled \u201cCharacterization of Electrical Load Demand to Design the Optimal Photovoltaic and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) using Advanced Machine Learning Technique.\u201d The purpose of this dataset is to support reproducible research, enable benchmarking of predictive algorithms, and provide a foundation for future studies in renewable energy optimization and machine learning applications. The dataset is organized into four separate Excel files, each corresponding to a different random variability (RV) case of load demand: 5% Day-to-Day \/ 5% Time Step, 10%\/10%, 15%\/15%, and 20%\/20%. These RV cases capture the stochastic behavior of demand and generation fluctuations, thereby offering realistic conditions for model training and evaluation. Each file contains results from an optimized HRES configuration, integrating solar photovoltaic (SPV), lithium-ion battery storage (Mohit100LI), a grid connection, and an inverter system.The parameters included in the dataset cover both technical and economic aspects of the system. Technical indicators include PV installed capacity, maximum power point tracking (SPV-MPPT), inverter output (rectifier and inverter mean outputs), annual renewable fraction, and storage performance metrics such as nominal capacity, usable capacity, autonomy, and annual throughput. Economic indicators include Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), initial capital investment, and operating cost. Additionally, grid-related data such as annual energy purchased and sold are provided, reflecting the dynamic interaction between the HRES and external power supply. For example, under the VR (5\/5) case, the dataset records a renewable fraction of approximately 35%, with PV production exceeding 1.35 million kWh per year and grid purchases around 2.39 million kWh. Similar structured outputs are available for the other RV scenarios, allowing researchers to compare the sensitivity of HRES performance across different demand fluctuations.The dataset is particularly suited for applications in advanced machine learning, where predictive models can be trained to estimate optimal system sizing, cost-performance trade-offs, and demand-side management strategies. It also serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating stochastic optimization techniques and forecasting algorithms in renewable energy studies. By making present dataset publicly available, the current study contributes to advancing open science in energy research. It enables academics, engineers, and policymakers to develop, test, and validate models for sustainable energy system planning under uncertainty, with practical relevance to regions experiencing similar climatic and demand variability conditions."""

Since wind power and solar&nbsp;energy have naturally complementary characteristics, that is,&nbsp;solar irradiation is abundant during the day, while the wind is strong&nbsp;during the night. In summer, there is adequate solar irradiation and&nbsp;scare winds. In winter and spring, there are stronger winds&nbsp;and insufficient solar irradiation. By utilizing the complementarity of&nbsp;wind and solar resources, the integrated wind-solar-storage system&nbsp;can effectively reduce the intermittency of renewable generations,&nbsp;promote renewable electricity consumption ability, improve&nbsp;energy utilization and system operation efficiency, and reduce carbon emission. In the dataset, there are 8 wind generations and 14 roof-top solar generations in total.&nbsp;&nbsp;The complementary wind power and PV generation data are&nbsp;based on real data from South China.&nbsp;"

It includes the carbon trading prices from the Hubei carbon market and other relevant feature data that may influence carbon prices. The feature data has undergone preliminary screening and consists of Brent crude oil prices, natural gas prices, Rotterdam coal prices, EU Emission Allowances, the China Securities 300 Index, and the Euro exchange rate. These features may influence the fluctuations of carbon trading prices in the Hubei carbon market to some extent, and further analysis is required to determine their specific impact. The data was collected from publicly available sources on the internet."
