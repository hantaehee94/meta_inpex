Abstract,This set of indicators focuses on the level of investment allocated to start-ups in the energy sector and beyond. It will allow the evaluation of the share of investment in energy start-ups in total start-up investment as well as the level of start-up investment observed in the different Energy fields. The indicators focus on entrepreneurial firms ? also called de novo ? thereby excluding spin-offs from incumbent firms.
