The data presented here provide renewable energy potential by state and by category, there is an option for download in CSV or Excel format. The primary benefit of assessing technical potential is that it establishes an upper-boundary estimate of development potential. It is important to understand that there are multiple types of potential: resource, technical, economic, and market - each seen in the \""Key Assumptions\"" resource below.\n\nFor updated data on renewable energy resource potential and siting considerations please see the \""Siting Lab\"" link below.
