Abstract,"This dataset features Australian hydrogen projects that are active in the development, construction, or operating phase, and meet renewable hydrogen or carbon capture and storage (CCS) hydrogen production methods outlined in Australia's National Hydrogen Strategy. This dataset aims is to provide a detailed snapshot of hydrogen activity across Australia. It includes location data, proponent details, and descriptions for all hydrogen projects listed. Additional data is included, such as the energy source for hydrogen production, the method of hydrogen production, and the amount of hydrogen to be produced per year. This dataset is the basis of the point-location map of active Australian hydrogen projects featured on the Australia Hydrogen Opportunities Tool (AusH2.ga.gov.au). AusH2 aims to attract investment in AustraliaÅfs hydrogen industry, providing high quality, free, online geospatial analysis tools and data for mapping and understanding AustraliaÅfs hydrogen potential. It hosts key national-scale datasets, such as locations of wind and solar resources and distribution of infrastructure, as well as the Hydrogen Economic Fairways Tool (HEFT) that maps the economic viability of hydrogen production in Australia. The user can examine both hydrogen production by electrolysis using renewable energy sources and fossil fuel produced hydrogen coupled with CCS. AusH2 was produced by Geoscience Australia for the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy CouncilÅfs Hydrogen Working Group in 2019. Updates to this dataset since September 2020 are coordinated with research.csiro.au/HyResource",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lineage,"This dataset is an output of the 'Australian Hydrogen Projects' point-location map published to the 'AusH2 - Australia's Hydrogen Opportunities Tool'. The AusH2 tool was commissioned in 2019 by the then Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (DIIS) on behalf of the National Hydrogen Taskforce, which was established by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council. The original hydrogen projects dataset was published in June 2020 and since September 2020 updates to the dataset have been coordinated with research.csiro.au/HyResource. Since March 2022, hydrogen research centres are no longer included in the dataset as they are compiled by HyResearch (https://research.csiro.au/hyresearch/).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
